# Project 1 - Draft Phase

## Setup:

In the 'Projects' folder of your reporitory, create a folder called 'Project1'.

Your work for this project will be done in this 'Project1' folder.

In this folder, copy the `.gitignore` file and contents.  Make sure you call it `.gitignore`

`.gitignore` files list files and folders that you want git to ignore.  This helps a lot if you are on the command line lazy using `*` or tend to zone out and click buttons.
