# Project 1 - Final Draft

## Setup:

See [Rough Draft Phase](project1.0.md) description for full set of details regarding the setup of this project.

## Final Phase Requirements:

1. Make improvements / continue your project based on feedback given in Pilot with respect to the rough draft phase.

2. The final version of your project code should be in a `.py` file. 

3. Update your `README.md` in your `Project1` folder to include the following information:
    - The purpose of this project
    - Your final visualization(s)
        - Hint: to include an image that exists in a repo, the syntax is:
        ```
        ![Alternate text here for ADA compliance](Images/markdown-demo.png-OR-path_to_image)
        ```
        - I know your plot may no longer be interactive (just static).  That's okay, don't sweat it.
    - A written description of what your visualization(s) shows and what story it tells.

## Project Scope (How to Retreat):

If you are working on your project and realizing you may have bitten off more than you can chew, you are allowed to fall back on the project suggestions listed in the [Rough Draft Phase](project1.0.md)
