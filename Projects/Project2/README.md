# Project 2

## Project Description

This project utilizes two data files:
- id-hw-exams.csv - contains student names, ids, and homework and exam grades
- id-section.csv - contains student names, ids, university ids, and section number

The output of this project is a report that helps the instructor analyze:
- the grades for each assignment
- the overall performace of each section (in terms of final grades)

## Instructor Report

### Homework 1:
- Lowest Score: 0.0
- Highest Score: 1.0
- Average Score: 0.7752499999999999
- Standard Deviation from Average: 0.13725550257303776

#### Repeat for homeworks 1 - 10 and exams 1 - 3

### Point Based Grade Distribution (do this or do letter grade)
Note: If you can't get by section, don't sweat it

#### Point across all sections
- (0, 60]            0
- (60, 70]           0
- (70, 80]          77
- (80, 90]          72
- (90, 100]          1


### Letter Grade Distribution
Note: if you convert to final scores to their ceiling score, you'll get this same result.  If you use the pure score, you'll see these numbers change.

#### Section 1:
- B: 29
- C: 26
- A: 1

#### Section 2: 
- B: 31
- C: 20

#### Section 3: 
- B: 25
- C: 18

### Correlation

#### Correlation between homework and letter grades

- Result: 0.705597
- Postive correlation scores are between 0.5 and 1.  With 0.7 correlation, there is a correlation between scoring well on homeworks and scoring well for the final grade

#### Correlation between exams and letter grade

- Result: 0.752064
- Postive correlation scores are between 0.5 and 1.  With 0.75 correlation, there is a correlation between scoring well on exams and scoring well for the final grade
