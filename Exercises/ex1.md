# Exercise Set 1

## Setup:

This lab expects that you have already installed tools per the syllabus & lecture notes and have setup your course repository at https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/cs2900-python-YOURGITHUBNAME.  You can also [reference the install guide](https://github.com/pattonsgirl/SU2021-CS2900#Software)

For this lab, create a Jupyter Notebook in your `Exercises` folder called `ex1.ipynb`

**Put each `Part` of the exercise set in its own cell**

## Part 1:
Create a list of 40 random numbers between 5 and 50.
Find and print the average of the list.  Have the print statement be in the following format:
```
The average of the list is: 45.2
```

Cite the source(s) you use for your code as comments.  You can cite your own brilliance

## Part 2:
Use the two lists provided below to solve the following:
```
known_ips = ['12.45.23.1', '89.34.23.67', '67.45.23.43', '90.32.65.98']
new_ips = ['45.23.98.12', '89.23.21.9', '67.45.23.43', '1.1.1.1']
```
Add the new ip addresses to the known ip addresses list with the following restrictions:
- Do not add duplicate ips to the known ips list
- Do not add '1.1.1.1' to the known ips list
- By the end of the program, the new_ips list should be empty

Output the final version of the 'known_ips' list such that it looks like:
```
Known IP Addresses Updated:
    12.45.23.1
    89.34.23.67
    67.45.23.43
    90.32.65.98
    45.23.98.12
    89.23.21.9
```

Cite the source(s) you use for your code as comments.  You can cite your own brilliance

## Part 3:
Given the list below, write a condition that will print `buzz buzz` for all camelcase iteration of the word 'bees'.
```
camelcase = ['bees', 'BEES', 'BeEs', 'Bees', 'BeeS']
```
Final expected output:
```
buzz buzz
buzz buzz
buzz buzz
buzz buzz
buzz buzz
```
