What would you like to discover about this data?

What visualization seems useful to either help with the discovery, or as an additional discovery?

Ideas:

1. Weather compare - compare this year's temperature to a few year's ago for Dayton, OH.  Only using high temperatures, create a line graph with both. Determine if there has been a change. 

2. Car accidents & weekdays - histogram of which day of the week had a car crash.  Determine if there is any correlation

3. Parse auth.log for usernames, timestamps, and ip addresses.  Get count of all usernames - determine top 5. Generate pie chart of username's attempted.
