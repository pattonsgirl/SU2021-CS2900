# Exercise Set 6

## Setup:

This lab expects that you have already installed tools per the syllabus & lecture notes and have setup your course repository at https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/cs2900-python-YOURGITHUBNAME.  You can also [reference the install guide](https://github.com/pattonsgirl/SU2021-CS2900#Software)

For this lab, create a Jupyter Notebook in your `Exercises` folder called `ex6.ipynb`

**Put each `Part` of the exercise set in its own cell**

## Part 1:

You will be using [silly-survey-v2.csv](silly-survey-v2.csv) in this folder.  Since this repo and the data in it is public, here is the link if you'd rather use it: 
Pi chart of favorite colors
Pi chart of majors
Mean favorite number when user is allowed to write an answer
Mode of number chosen when user is given set of choices



Cite the source(s) you use for your code as comments.  You can cite your own brilliance
