# Exercise Set 5

## Setup:

This lab expects that you have already installed tools per the syllabus & lecture notes and have setup your course repository at https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/cs2900-python-YOURGITHUBNAME.  You can also [reference the install guide](https://github.com/pattonsgirl/SU2021-CS2900#Software)

For this lab, create a Jupyter Notebook in your `Exercises` folder called `ex5.ipynb`

**Put each `Part` of the exercise set in its own cell**

## Part 1:



Cite the source(s) you use for your code as comments.  You can cite your own brilliance
