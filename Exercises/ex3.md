# Exercise Set 3 - NOT FINALIZED

## Setup:

This lab expects that you have already installed tools per the syllabus & lecture notes and have setup your course repository at https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/cs2900-python-YOURGITHUBNAME.  You can also [reference the install guide](https://github.com/pattonsgirl/SU2021-CS2900#Software)

For this lab, create a Jupyter Notebook in your `Exercises` folder called `ex3.ipynb`

## Part 1:

DIY dataset - save to file basic-data.txt in the `Exercises` folder'

Previously, you made a list of random numbers.  Output the randomly generated list to a file called basic-data.txt

## Part 2:

Open the basic-data.txt file for reading.  Using the data in the file, output the mean, median, and mode.

## Part 3:

Create a file called ip-updates.txt

The file should have the following contents:

Given a starting list of:

Read the file line by line and investigate using .split() to parse each line.  For each line, add only new ips addresses and ip addresses that are not '1.1.1.1'.
